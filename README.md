# Welcome to Github
## Creating an account

You can create a personal Github account following the [directions here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github#signing-up-for-a-new-personal-account). 

> [!NOTE]
> It is reccomended that you use  apersonal email address, not your Tufts email address as your accounts primary email so that you can use your Github account after graduatation. You can then add your Tufts email [as an additional email](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/how-tos/email-preferences/adding-an-email-address-to-your-github-account) if desired. 

## Starting an assignment

Links for accessing each assignment will be posted on Piazza. However, you can practice with the CS15 Starter Project which you can find [at this link](https://classroom.github.com/a/rFkH85E7).

Selecting that link will allow you to create a new assignment. You can then clone the assignment to your halligan account and run the project setup script from your repo as per normal. 

> [!NOTE]
> Typically, project repoositories will contain a `.gitignore` file and a starter `README`. You need to add the rest of the files! 

## Using git during your assignment
## Adding to your readme

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You need to make mention of your repository in your README! If you do not, you will NOT recieve credit.
