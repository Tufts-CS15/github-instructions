# Welcome to Github
## Creating an account

You can create a personal Github account following the [directions here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github#signing-up-for-a-new-personal-account). 

> [!NOTE]
> It is reccomended that you use  apersonal email address, not your Tufts email address as your accounts primary email so that you can use your Github account after graduatation. You can then add your Tufts email [as an additional email](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/how-tos/email-preferences/adding-an-email-address-to-your-github-account) if desired.
